# Jesse  and Cookies (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jesse-and-cookies/problem)

"""
Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value k.
To do this, two cookies with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:

sweetness = (lx Least sweet cookie + 2x 2nd least sweet cookie).

This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness 2 k.

Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required. 
If it is not possible, return â€”1.
