"""
Chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym. The
monthly cost of the gym is X and personal training will cost him an additional Y per month. Chef's
total budget per month is only Z. Print 1 if Chef can only join the gym, 2 if he can also have a personal
trainer, and if he can't even join the gym.
Note that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer, he mustjoin the gym â€” he cannot hire the trainer
without joining the gym.
