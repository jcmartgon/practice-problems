There are 10 problems in a contest. You know that the score of each problem is either 1 or 100 points.
Chef came to know the total score of a participant and he is wondering how many problems were
actually solved by that participant.
Given the total score P of the participant, determine the number of problems solved by the
participant. Print â€”1 in case the score is invalid.
