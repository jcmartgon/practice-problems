# Flip the cards (https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLIPCARDS)

"""
There are N cards on a table, out of which X cards are face-up and the remaining are face-down.
In one operation, we can do the following:
â€¢ Select any one card and flip it (i.e. if it was initially face-up, after the operation, it will be face-down
and vice versa)
What is the minimum number of operations we must perform so that all the cards face in the same
direction (i.e. either all are face-up or all are face-down)?

    print(min(a, b))
