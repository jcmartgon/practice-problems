"""
Chef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. There are 2N students in the class,
with distinct roll numbers ranging from 1 to 2N. Chefs roll number is X.
The professor decided to create N groups of 2 students each. The groups were created as follows: the
first group consists of roll numbers I and 2N, the second group of roll numbers 2 and 2N â€” I, and so
on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers N and N + 1.
Chef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?
