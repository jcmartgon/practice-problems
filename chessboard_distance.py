"""
The Chessboard Distance for any two points (Xl, YI) and (X2, Y2) on a Cartesian plane is defined as
mac(IX1 -X21,lY1 - Y21).
You are given two points (Xl, YI) and (X2, Y2). Output their Chessboard Distance.
Note that, IPl denotes the absolute value of integer P. For example, I â€” 41 = 4 and 171 = 7.
