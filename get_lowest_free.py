Chef goes to the supermarket to buy some items. Luckily there's a sale going on under which Chef gets
the following offer:
â€¢ If Chef buys 3 items then he gets the item (out of those 3 items) having the lowest price as free.
For e.g. if Chef bought 3 items with the cost 6, 2 and 4. then he would get the item with cost 2 as free.
So he would only have to pay the cost of the other two items which will be 6 + 4 = 10.
Chef buys 3 items having prices A B and C respectively. What is the amount of money Chef needs to
pay?
