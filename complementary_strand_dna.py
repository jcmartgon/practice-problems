# Complementary strand in a DNA (https://www.codechef.com/problems/DNASTRAND)

"""
You are given the sequence of Nucleotides of one strand of DNA through a string S of length N. S
contains the character A, T, C, and G only.
Chef knows that:
A is complementary to T.
T is complementary to A.
C is complementary to G.
â€¢ G is complementary to C.
Using the string S, determine the sequence of the complementary strand of the DNA
